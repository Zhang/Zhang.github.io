        <a class="title">We will build your Rx Inventory Management system. <i><b>Free.</b></i></a>
        <p>We're <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sqz684/">Scott</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/syam-palakurthy/">Syam</a>, healthcare technologists in the San Francisco Bay Area with >10 years of experience in the industry. We're building <a target="_blank" href="http://sama.health/">a company</a> to help providers manage their inventory and reduce medical waste.</p>

        <a class="title">We believe in working closely with our end users.</a>
        <p>My cofounder and I want to co-develop this tool with your practice. We win because we get valuable insights from getting an up-close perspective of your workflows while you get a tool customized to your needs.</p>

        <a class="title">Good candidates with real challenges.</a>
        <p>We want to work with providers where getting Rx inventory management right is vital. Specifically, we're focused on clinics that administer a high volume of infusible or injectable drugs. We're open to other providers, but we want to make sure we're solving a critical problem for you.</p>

        <a class="title">FAQ</a>
        <p><b>How long will this take?</b> This will take two months with three weeks spent onsite. Half our onsite time will be spent learning existing processes and half will be spent rolling out your custom tool. We will spend as much time as necessary to perfect your experience, but we believe two months is enough from our past experiences.</p>
